1. TABLE STRUCTURES:

A. Main Table (lib_book):
```sql
CREATE TABLE lib_book(
    bid INT,             -- Book ID (unique identifier)
    bname VARCHAR(20),   -- Book Name
    qty INT             -- Quantity available
);
```
Purpose:
- Stores main library book records
- Contains current/active book information

B. Audit Table (lib_audit):
```sql
CREATE TABLE lib_audit(
    bid INT,             -- Book ID from main table
    bname VARCHAR(20),   -- Book Name before change
    qty INT             -- Quantity before change
);
```
Purpose:
- Tracks historical changes
- Stores previous values before update/delete

2. TRIGGER COMPONENTS:

A. Delete Trigger:
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER Make_audit1 
AFTER DELETE ON lib_book    -- Triggers after delete operation
FOR EACH ROW               -- Row-level trigger
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO lib_audit(bid, bname, qty)
    VALUES(OLD.bid, OLD.bname, OLD.qty);
END
```
Key Points:
- AFTER DELETE: Executes after deletion
- FOR EACH ROW: Processes each affected row
- OLD: References deleted data
- Captures deleted record

B. Update Trigger:
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER make_audit2
AFTER UPDATE ON lib_book    -- Triggers after update operation
FOR EACH ROW               -- Row-level trigger
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO lib_audit(bid, bname, qty)
    VALUES(OLD.bid, OLD.bname, OLD.qty);
END
```
Key Points:
- AFTER UPDATE: Executes after update
- OLD: References pre-update data
- Stores previous values

3. TRIGGER TYPES DEMONSTRATED:

A. Timing:
   - AFTER Triggers
   - Execute after the main operation
   - Ensure data consistency

B. Event Level:
   - Row Level (FOR EACH ROW)
   - Executes once per affected row
   - Granular tracking

4. DATA FLOW:

```
Operation Flow:
DELETE/UPDATE on lib_book → Trigger Activated → Record in lib_audit
```

Example for DELETE:
```sql
Initial lib_book:
bid=1, bname="GOT", qty=10

After DELETE FROM lib_book WHERE bid=1;

lib_audit gets:
bid=1, bname="GOT", qty=10  
```

Example for UPDATE:
```sql
Initial lib_book:
bid=2, bname="Harry", qty=20

After UPDATE lib_book SET bname='harry potter' WHERE bid=2;

lib_audit gets:
bid=2, bname="Harry", qty=20
```

5. KEY CONCEPTS:

A. OLD and NEW References:
- OLD: Previous values
- NEW: New values (not used in this example)
- Available in row-level triggers

B. Trigger Timing:
- BEFORE: Pre-operation
- AFTER: Post-operation
- Affects data access

6. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS:

A. Audit Trail:
- Track changes
- Historical record
- Data recovery

B. Data Management:
- Change tracking
- Version control
- Quality assurance

7. IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:

A. Performance:
- Additional storage needed
- Processing overhead
- Transaction impact

B. Maintenance:
- Regular cleanup needed
- Storage management
- Index optimization

8. SAMPLE OPERATIONS AND RESULTS:

```sql
-- Initial Data:
INSERT INTO lib_book VALUES(1, "GOT", 10);

-- After Delete:
DELETE FROM lib_book WHERE bid=1;
→ lib_audit gets: (1, "GOT", 10)

-- After Update:
UPDATE lib_book SET bname='harry potter' WHERE bid=2;
→ lib_audit gets: (2, "Harry", 20)
```

9. ERROR HANDLING:

A. Potential Issues:
- Table space
- Lock contention
- Trigger recursion

B. Best Practices:
- Error logging
- Exception handling
- Transaction management

10. BENEFITS:

A. Data Tracking:
- Change history
- Audit compliance
- Data recovery

B. Security:
- Change monitoring
- Access tracking
- Compliance support

Would you like me to:
1. Explain any specific component in more detail?
2. Show how to add more audit fields?
3. Demonstrate different trigger types?
4. Explain error handling methods?
5. Show performance optimization techniques?

Remember: These triggers maintain a history of changes, which is crucial for:
- Data auditing
- Change tracking
- Regulatory compliance
- Data recovery
- System debugging
